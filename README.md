# Markdown: Creating nice documentation

This method of write documentation is for describing anything, projects, code, guides, etc. Markdown has titles (#), subtitles(like HTML, from h2 ("##"), to h4 ("####")), ordered lists ("1)"), unordered lists ("-"), images, links, and HTML code.


This is an update.

# Title: use # in the start of the text

## Subtitle: use ## in the start of the text

- Unordered list: use - in the start of the text

1. Ordered list: use x. (being x a number) in the start

[Links](https://www.google.com): use [link] in the start and a (text) after that

![Imagen de gato](./imagen.png): Use [imagen path] and (text)

It's all. Thanks
